    <p>For those of us who are the mutts of humanity - born into a people but not fully the “real version”, not sophisticated blends of endorsed European stock, but the descendents of survivors that weren’t necessarily winners (although maybe winning is surviving), a complete history is not often our birthright. Whether your ancestors were the colonized or the enslaved or crossing borders they were not meant to, your history is probably missing from books. It probably lives in stories - wisps of hearsay passed down from someone who happened to be in the room when an older relative was telling stories, prejudices about the speaker twisting the weak points and layers of embellishment fossilizing to fill the space of things forgotten. And where are the facts? In some dusty old tome; perhaps missing.</p>

<p>Trying to piece together the history of artist Curtis Talwst Santiago likewise requires a little bit of effort. He has a Wikipedia page describing him as a Toronto-based dance-rock musician from Edmonton, Alberta, but to find his exact birth year (1979) one needs to click through several gallery page exhibition blurbs to find an extra-verbose CV. Other features highlight different aspects of his prolific career, such as his dioramas or video work, but in an attempt to maintain focus, ignore one another.</p>

<p>I first encountered Curtis Talwst Santiago’s work when I popped into the Drawing Center in SoHo in early 2020 and saw the first few rooms of the gallery transformed into the multimedia installation <em>Can’t I Alter</em>. With this collection of mixed media drawings and sculpture, Santiago brings viewers along with him on a journey through a world fed with personal experience, imagination and research.</p>

<p>From a stark childhood memory of his first encounter with J’Ouvert, a Trinidadi festival commemorating the first time formerly enslaved people could celebrate Carnival and a recent quest into the origins of a 16th century Flemish painting depicting an African Knight of the Order or Santiago, the artist birthed Sir Dingolay. Serving as both the show’s hero and the artist’s alter ego, Dingolay is one of the threads that ties together Can’t I Alter’s disparate elemements.</p>

<p>Immediately upon entering the viewer encounters a Sir Dingolay’s life-size beaded armor, (a reference to the mental ‘armor’ the artist needs traveling the world as a person on color), which feels at once solemn, joyful and imposing. Nestled inside <em>J’Ouvert Knight</em>, (the only diorama in this collection) our hero appears in prescious miniature. “As with many such objects, this container was likely commissioned as a personal devotional object for a wealthy patron,” the catologue states. Sir Dingolay also makes an appearance in several of the medium-large (3 foot square) drawings on canvas that form the bread and butter of the exhibit, such as <em>Candy Flipping (Boogoo Pouring the Spell in Sir Dingolay’s Ear)</em> or as a glowing silhouette in <em>The Four of them Made a Promise</em>. If Sir Dingolay stands in for Curtis Talwst Santiago are these otherwordly traces based on the artist’s true history?</p>

<p>The pair of spray-paint drawings on embossed tin tiles <em>She Knight</em> and <em>He Knight</em>, further elaborate on the knight’s mythology. I feel these incarnations give the knight some gravitas; now that he has a companion he feels more like a person and less like a manic force tilting at windmills. Depicting both male and female knights on equal scale solidly refutes the antiquated misconception that the empowerment of men of color might depend on the disempowerment of women of color. In a music video playing in the central room Curtis Talwst Santiago finally dons the beaded armor and transforms into Sir Dirgolay. Surrounded by ruins with red pigment brightening his face, he dances the night away to his father’s favorite song (a Calypso tune by the Mighty Sparrow). In this way it all cascades down into the present, all brimming with blood and life.</p>

<p>Another motif is “red face”. Red clay face paint is a central part of of the J’ouvert festival, and by using reddish spraypaint to turn the faces of various ‘untitled ancestors’ and mythical creatures, the artist creates an interconnected mystique for these beings to which he pays homage. 
Other times spraypaint just represents a diffuse light, as in <em>A luz (the light)</em>, bathing the entire drawing of a robed figure in an archway in a fuzzy glow. In <em>A morte do cavaleiro prateado (The Death of the Silver Knight</em>, spraypaint illiminates the face of the J’Ouvert Knight and the nocturnal city in the distance, but neither the plants and trees of the foreground nor the face of the dying companion.</p>

<p>Santiago incorporates real light in only one scupture – a giant nose the size of a motorcycle engine made of golden translucent glass, called <em>Warahoon</em>. Tucked away behind a replica of a real stone arch that the artist lived near during his time in Bresca, Italy, the nose glows mysteriously from its place on a fluted columnar pedestal. Closer inspection reveals ths sculpture to be a bit tongue-in-cheek. “In leiu of the bust to which this nose belongs, the curators have chosen to display only the nose – the other side of the history so often seen in museums,” reads the exihibion catalogue. Iconoclasts seeking to deface statues of deceased individuals (e.g. grave robbers) in Anciant Egypt (Kemet) often broke off statues’ noses, leaving contemporary viewers with a slew of noseless (or worse, poorly restored Caucasian-nosed) statues. With this nose the artist pays a tribute to all the noses lost to history, and all the stories lost with them.</p>

<p>I may not be Triniadi, and the blanks I have to fill in may look different from Santiago’s, but seeing this body of work gave me a sense of hope that’s hard to describe. It felt as if this series of attempts to evoke something elusive yet vital. That even if you can’t ever get to a full picture, it’s worth chasing after the blanks in the historical record. Its worth looking for your ancestors. It’s possible to create your own mythology. Imagining in the blanks doesn’t necessarily make your mythology less real.</p>

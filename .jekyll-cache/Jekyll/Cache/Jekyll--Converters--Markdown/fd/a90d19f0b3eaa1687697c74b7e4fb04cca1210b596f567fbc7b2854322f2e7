<p><strong>AN:</strong> Lately I’ve been to thinking about how to build an art practice that carries multicultural, contemporary, and non-normative lens. One of the problems I’ve faced is a lack of history – people in these categories tend to get written out, repressed or supressed.  This is foundation-work, but if you’re not part of a privileged minority (the one that likes to imagine itself as “The Majority”), the historic foundation you should have inherited is likely to be hidden or erased. As a solution to that problem I’ve become fascinated with the idea of writing your own history.</p>

<p>This is something you essentially did, through a printmaking workshop called the Queer Ancestors Project. What was that like?</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> So I think I found the Queer Ancestors Project from an ad on Instagram, and it was billed as a free linocut workshop for queer people aged 18-26 with any range of experience in linocut printing. I think part of the reason it was attractive to me was that I’ve always had some level of impostor syndrome around the idea of doing art, because I think the way I was raised was very anti-pursuing-art-as-a-career and also anti-hobby. It was very much like either you do something and it leads toward some kind of capitalist productivity or it has no worth, so I think for me being able to do this workshop was a very important transitional stepping stone in being able to separate art from capitalist notions of worth. Because it ended in an art exhibition, it allowed me to put everything into what I was working on and really invest in it because there was a goal. Then afterwards [I could] start divesting from having goals in my art practice.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> So it was as much about the art as it was the ancestry and Queer culture.</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Yeah, very much.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> What was being in the program like?</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> We had some structure and some freedom. We had to make four prints. For the first print we had to just pick a queer ancestor, and Katie gave us a list that we could choose from but we didn’t have to, and we also had a visit to the GLBT archives which are super fucking cool!</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> How did you decide what to make prints about?</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> I started out wanting to look into Queer Asian history, because I don’t really know much about Asian American history, let alone Queer Asian American history, and I think I had a lot of assumptions based on my experiences growing up: that Asian American activism was all like, shitty assimilationist politics, since the suburb that I grew up in was very much like “Chinese Americans Against Affirmative Action” type activism. Being in the Bay Area I’m starting to realize that there’s a really really deep history of radical Asian American Activism and radical Queer Asian American Activism that I was really close to.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> The Queer Ancestors Project has an extensive online gallery featuring work from participants over the years. I really enjoyed being able to check out both your work and the work of so many other talented artists. It’s really clear that each artist has a story to tell and a unique way of using linocut to do that. Could I ask you talk about the prints you made?</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Yeah absolutely!</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> So the first is titled “Phoenix Rising,” named for the first Asian/Pacific Islander Lesbian newsletter in the US, which was founded in San Francisco in 1984.</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> The phoenix one was the first print I ever did, and it was also the first time I’d done art in like, forever. I really wanted to do Asian imagery, and I think it was my first time incorporating Asian imagery into any artwork I was doing and it was nice to have an excuse because there was a Phoenix in the title already. One thing I wanted to do in that piece was [play with] the fenghuang (phoenix) and the dragon pairing. They are a really traditional Chinese pairing, like yin and yang, or the emperor and the empress, man and wife; it’s a really common heterosexual Chinese thing. There’s some implication that the phoenix is pure and delicate and the dragon is strong and can attack, and in having two phoenixes as a pair instead I really wanted them to be interdependent, like, I didn’t want there to be a power dynamic. The way I portrayed them I wanted them to be both attacking an unseen opponent and both defending each other. I think that represents the kind of “For Us, By Us” [attitude] I’d like to see in our community.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> One of the members of Phoenix Rising was eventually invited to speak as part of the workshop. Could you talk about what that was like?</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> I got to meet two elders in person, one was Giselle Cohan, and she was one of the co-founders of Phoenix Rising, which was the first Asian American Lesbian newsletter in the United States, and it was basically a publication they’d send out monthly for several years. It had picnics or like news about a gathering in the forest a bunch of Asian Queers did one weekend, and fundraisers and personals. It was super interesting because she works in tech [and] the way she talks about herself she makes it seem like she has a pretty quiet life [despite her] involvement [being] so seminal and so historical. [It] allowed me to unpack some of the guilt that I had about being here and being in tech and just the things that I was navigating. And then I also got meet Kitty Tsui, although we didn’t actually get to talk.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> Speaking of Kitty Tsui, you ended up honoring her with a print as well. It’s a really powerful image, with bold square lines framing the powerful contours and textures of Tsui’s athletic body — a body that is literally busting out of the frame. In your artist’s statement you quote Tsui writing in 1996, “Growing up in Hong Kong, I heard all around me mothers yelling at their children: ‘Say nui, mo no, mo yung!’ Dead girl, no brain, no use… For me as an Asian/Pacific lesbian, silence is not an option. To ensure that we…be acknowledged as who we are. Women with a history…Women who survived being dead girls.” (“Asian Pacific Lesbian a.k.a Dead Girl, China Doll, Dragon Lady, or the Invisible Man”).</p>

<p>What do you think it means to be a “dead girl”? I’ve never heard that phrase before.</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> I’d never actually heard it before either. I think the way Kitty was talking about it was probably talking about pretty misogynistic culture, and I think in that sense Chinese culture is very misogynistic. The other day my mom sent me this photo of an old Chinese scroll that had like two poems and I asked her to translate them for me and she said, the first poem is about raising a daughter and how your daughter is the most delicate flower that you spend all your days watering and it grows so beautiful and slender and delicate and you do everything you can to make it grow as beautifully as possible, and one day a man comes and plucks it with no thanks to you! And then the second half is about raising a son, like raising a son is like opening a bank account that you deposit all your money into, and you work so hard and you deposit everything into it, and then one day this woman comes and just takes the whole bank account without any gratitude. And I’m like this is like so awful, why would you send me this? So I think there’s all this history of the one child policy and how there aren’t enough girls because everyone only wanted men, because they keep the family line going, etc. etc, and women aren’t necessarily supposed to be out there having their own opinions. It’s very confusing, I don’t really get it. But I think maybe that’s partially what it’s about.</p>

<p>…OH actually, I just found it: In this Cantonese dictionary, there’s this term “bad girl,” like in the way you might say to you cat “you’re being a bad girl!” It’s an abusive term for a bad girl, and the characters in it are literally like “dead” “daughter” or “dead” “woman”.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> I mean I guess people say some mean things to their kids when they want them to behave. It’s funny how people say so many throw-away things to children when they’re young and we really internalize them and remember them even after we’re much older. The way Tsui holds up this memory as she’s encouraging other Queer Asians not to be silenced is a really cool piece of writing. First in the way she humanizes herself as not this invincible activist but a person who still grapples with her past to be able to speak her truth. It also reminds me of the slogan from the AIDS crisis “Silence = Death,” and implying that together her community can turn it on its head. Like if silence will kill you, speaking your truth might make you more alive.</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> I like that a lot. That reminds be a little bit of this Junot Diaz’s quote: “…if you want to make a human being into a monster, deny them, at the cultural level, any reflection of themselves. And growing up, I felt like a monster in some ways. I didn’t see myself reflected at all. I was like, “Yo, is something wrong with me? That the whole society seems to think that people like me don’t exist?” And part of what inspired me, was this deep desire that before I died, I would make a couple of mirrors. That I would make some mirrors so that kids like me might see themselves reflected back and might not feel so monstrous for it.”</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> I think my favorite work from this series is your self portrait. Printed in smoldering tones of red, orange and yellow, you depict yourself sitting nude, eyes closed and maintaining immense focus despite the dragon curled around you hanging over your right shoulder. It bears the title “平常心 (píng cháng xīn)”, which you translate as meaning ‘peace of mind’, one’s natural self, or ‘an unagitated mind’. Could you talk a bit about what went in to making this image?</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> It’s styled after these paintings [called thanka paintings] that are hung throughout my aunt and grandmother’s homes that are from the Tibetan buddhist tradition, usually portraying the Buddha near a place that you would pray to the Buddha. And part of that tradition as well is to be able to look at this portrayal of the Buddha or some deity-type figure, and be able to when meditating be able to think about all the Buddha-like qualities and aspire to embody them in yourself. I additionally added an eastern-style dragon that was wrapped around the halo, which also looks like a bubble or a protective circle. I think one of the things I was trying to do with the dragon is to make it unclear whether or not the dragon was protecting me or trying to harm me. I think that sort of perceived tension was meant to symbolize my relationship with my feelings. I was in a place in my life where I was realizing, despite thinking that I took time to feel my feelings every day, in retrospect I was actually pretty dissociated from them. My partner had mentioned that it would take me a long time to process my feelings, or I wouldn’t be even aware that I was feeling certain ways, like angry or defensive, [or] reacting in a triggered way. I had this sort of fantasy of myself as a person who was completely aware of my feelings and in control. And so it was also about that journey and trying to unpack my relationship with them.</p>

<p>And then part of it was I think me trying to get more comfortable with my body, which is why I did a nude self portrait. I definitely have and continue to have a lot of internalized fat-phobia and I think it’s something I really want to work on, and I am also realizing that I can’t work on it through anything other than working on my relationship with my own body and how I perceive it. That’s also why it’s naked.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> All of that is incredibly rad. I also think it’s interesting that you place yourself in this devotional image, this center, this object you’re supposed look at and think about when you are meditating, and to me, I mean, I come from a Christian tradition and it feels like, almost blasphemous, or at least very radical. It’s like saying you are your own ancestor in a way, you are your own God. Does it mean that to you a bit?</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Something we talked about a lot during the workshop was “Who are your Queer Ancestors?”  I think the notion of family has always been a really difficult one for me because I don’t feel like I have “Family’ in the way that maybe the Western tradition conditions you to think about what family should mean. And I think in terms of Queer role models, my elders and role models are mainly just my friends. This applies in other areas too, like with work and stuff, there’s no one person or people that I am able to pattern-match when it comes to what I want out of my life. I think a lot of the people my parents would like me to think of as role models are really antithetical to the things that I want.
I think there’s an aspect of loneliness to it too that I’m really only reflecting on now. I don’t really have my own gods. My own spirituality is very made-up and very personalized to me. I draw from a lot of different influences. My role models are all very piecemeal, and different things in different people. I don’t really have professional mentors, or people that I admire who are in a mentorship position. So I might be drawing on some of that. I don’t think I even thought about it that much, so it’s interesting to talk about it now.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> Well I think its really awesome and brave the way you have been forging your own path in that way. Thanks for sharing that, and being vulnerable.</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Thanks for asking and giving me space to talk about it.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> How did it feel to share all of this with the world at the closing reception?</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> It felt really good. It was such a trip. It was really packed, and it was really interesting to have people come up to me and say ”Wow, your art made me think about these things,” which was really sweet. Katie [Gilmartin, printmaker and creator of the Queer Ancestors Program] said one of her favorite parts about being the featured artist is you can talk to anyone you want at the entire event, and you’ll always have an excuse to do so, and I loved that, it’s so true. And as somebody who likes being able to meet people and not having to deal with social pressures or cues it was great to be able to show up at this thing, dress however the fuck I want. It was my first time really being in “the art world” and knowing without the shadow of a doubt that I could take up as much space as I wanted, and that made a lot of sense in the room.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> That’s so inspirational. I think there are definitely lessons in there that I’m trying to learn… And it sounds like you ended up finding what you were looking for when you first engaged with the Queer Ancestors Project. Are you feeling less impostor-syndrome today?</p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Yeah, I think so! Maybe instead of feeling less like an impostor I feel I care less about the idea that there are rules or that there’s an institution I’m trying to break into. Before I had this idea that artists were born artists and knew they wanted to do art from the moment they were born and have always been naturally talented which was also reinforced by the artists I did personally know. But lately I’ve been meeting people who have transitioned. One of my new friends is a full-time artist who does amazing work that I super love and she was a fucking accountant for a year and she was like, “This is awful. I got my degree in accounting and I did it, I proved to my mom that I can do it and I hate it and I’m going to go be an artist” and I think those kinds of transitional stories (including yours) make me feel like I want to have a relationship with art that is entirely my own and is not influenced by needing to do it for money or wanting to do it full time or anything like that.</p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> I think you definitely have a lot to say. Thanks so much for talking with me and sharing this experience. I’m looking forward to see what you make next!</p>

I"üL<p>It took me time to see Mary Cassatt. And then she saw me. The following is a bit of a love-letter:</p>

<p>Mary Cassatt is a familiar fixture if you‚Äôve heard of Impressionism. She painted a lot of women and children, used a. She was the lone female painter that was allowed to join the official group of Impressionists (although she did have loads of talented female contemporaries), but to me she didn‚Äôt really stand out. Her color palette was not as bold as Monet‚Äôs, her subjects not as exciting or varied as Manet‚Äôs, and her work didn‚Äôt undergo a dramatic public metamorphosis like Cezanne‚Äôs. Her subjects often sat in darkened rooms and looked demurely away. And the themes of motherhood and child-rearing felt romanticized and almost imaginary to me. I assumed she was celebrating the confines of old-school femininity. As a 21st century 20-something with an office job, this felt regressive at worst, and at best just not interesting.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>As I started painting more I began to appreciate her technical mastery. Cassatt has this unbelievable way of wrangling squirming humanity under her orderly influence without beating it into taxidermy-like submission. Even today, it‚Äôs better than a Live Photo or a Boomerang or any other painter at capturing a real person in a moment. The drawing is accurate, but the brush strokes are loose and painterly, responding to the texture and illumination of the surface she describes. It all feels effortlessly balanced on a knife‚Äôs edge as only Cassatt can channel. It made me jealous as I realized you could paint your entire life and probably never be able to do that. But I still was a bit irked that one of the few famous female painters focused so heavily on such boring subject matter.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>And then life happened. I lost a lot of the internalized sexism that I‚Äôd held on to as a girl who grew up in a lot of male-dominated spaces (punk rock, art collectives, computer engineering). This summer I had my own baby, and suddenly a lot of my time got filled with the physical rituals of caring for it. The rhythm of these rituals seeped into my life and sense of self. And through doing that work myself, I started to see wonder if Cassatt‚Äôs paintings weren‚Äôt really celebrating the Romanticism of Motherhood as much as the nobility of invisible female labor.</p>

<p>Was Cassatt really a feminist though? She totally was. Experience trying to survive in male-dominated spaces would tell you she‚Äôd be just as likely to advocate for the advancement of other women as to be one of those annoying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve-got-mine-now-you-get-yours‚Äù types who see other talented women as a threat, but she was definitely the former. Check out Cassatt‚Äôs (suspiciously destroyed/lost) mural for the Women‚Äôs Pavilion at the 1893 Chicago World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition and you won‚Äôt doubt it. She even had tons of talented female contemporaries (I caught an exhibition called Women In Motion at PAFA that was dedicated to several of them). Cassatt never married or had children, perhaps believing (not irrationally) taking on that vocation might preclude her ability to work as a painter, but she spent a lot of time with women who did take a more traditional path. While her male counterparts were able to work from the nude figure (women were not), Cassatt spent time contemplating the female figure in the context of domestic work. In private spaces, day after day, Cassatt saw women bathe, hold, cajole, and feed tiny humans, and for whatever reason decided their work was worthy of depiction. And the depictions are not stuffy vanity portraits of rich families and their angelic children ‚Äî they‚Äôre real, they do show the work.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>And so, as a new mom, sweaty and exhausted and struggling to feed my newborn at 3am, feeling grumpy yet proud to for once be doing essential labor, if Cassatt saw me, saw us, being as hard-working and dependable as Diego Rivera saw the motor workers in a Detroit factory. It felt nice.</p>

<h3 id="body-feeding">Body-Feeding</h3>

<p>What‚Äôs it been like learning to be a bodyfeeder?</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>Physical, emotional, and round-the clock. And completely different from the work done in my professional life. In my professional life I work at an agency where I‚Äôm a web developer. There are agreed-upon hours, contracts, coworkers, variety. It‚Äôs creative and intellectual work. The work/life balance is good, and if it wasn‚Äôt I could work somewhere else, or negotiate. I‚Äôm good at it, and if I wasn‚Äôt, someone else could do the job instead. By contrast body feeding has none of this translatable flexibility. Biology seems to ideally prefer a ‚Äúone-baby, one feeder‚Äù relationship ‚Äî lactation is an ability only unlocked by birth, and furthermore the amount of milk produced is carefully calibrated between  the baby and feeder via supply and demand. Finally, feeding is <em>essential.</em> This might sound romantic and self-important but it also means that someone else has a claim on your body and its labor. <em>Essential</em> things must be done when they need to be done, leaving the worker vulnerable to overwork and burnout. ‚ÄúThe worker‚Äù being me.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>The feeding job began immediately, in that weird, raw, postpartum haze. At first I was really bad at it, and found the schedule relentless. Newborns need to eat every 2 hours, and they drink slow. If a REM cycle is 3 hours, how do you like those sleep prospects? I knew almost nothing about nursing, except all mammals did it, so how hard could it be? There wasn‚Äôt really family knowledge I could access. I knew from old letters that my mom had be pretty solidly in the pro-formula camp (I think her generation saw it as a feminist coup, allowing other people to share in the feeding duties) and her sister said something to the effect of ‚Äúit‚Äôs too hard, you‚Äôll never make it‚Äù (she was a physician in the 90s and early otts). I also found most internet literature pretty unhelpful. Either it was some obnoxiously twee Earth-Mama lifestyle content, or yet another SEO-optimized version of The Four Nursing Holds (cradle hold! cross-cradle! side-lying! football!) that simply glossed over the many other hard parts, such as latching, how to tell when the baby is hungry or tired or has a lip-tie or just wants to suckle for comfort. The first effective nursing position I stumbled on you might call the ‚Äúfiddler crab‚Äù. It involved keeping my right forearm tightly flexed holding the baby‚Äôs entire body while I pinched my left nipple to make it as pointy and small as possible. This was only minorly effective and gave me back-aches. I spent many interim hours lying flat on the floor.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>It took practice to even reach ‚Äúfiddler crab‚Äù status. Over and over again I‚Äôd try to get my baby to latch, and instead of drinking, they would spit out the nipple, or choke and spit out the nipple, or worst lethargically drowse off without drinking anything at all. This was bad because if the baby doesn‚Äôt regularly latch and drink the pre-milk (called colostrum) your body won‚Äôt get any cues to start producing The Good Stuff in the next 3-5 days. Days passed and the baby steadily lost weight ‚Äî 3%, 5%, 7.6%, then 9.5%. Loss of 10% of birth weight means doctors will start pressuring you to supplement with formula. And not to judge anyone who chooses to use formula, but I didn‚Äôt want that. This was the plan and I felt if I failed, I‚Äôd be letting my baby, my partner, my midwife, to some degree my whole extended community, down.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>Luckily, I had help. My midwife asked another mom in our community to donate a bit of her pumped milk, and gave us a syringe to administer it in order to ‚Äúperk up‚Äù the baby if they started sleeping through meals. She also referred us to a lactation consultant who gave me some remedial ‚Äúlatching lessons‚Äù, and told me how to use a pump to get a milk supply going. She encouraged me as I struggled through that first tough week and within 7 days the baby was back up to birth weight! We were out of the woods.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>And just like that we were in business, and I was suddenly spending a lot of quality time with the baby, transferring milk. 8 to 12 times per day, 10 to 20 minutes at a time (not counting the minutes the baby takes a break and isn‚Äôt drinking). Sitting patiently, or impatiently. Dozing. Thinking.</p>

<h3 id="calories-of-power">Calories of Power</h3>

<p>Does it change me? Sure. At first it makes me feel like a piece of furniture, like my friend‚Äôs automatic cat feeder. One of those bodies hooked up to tubes in <em>The Matrix.</em></p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts while latch-trapped. On one of them I learn about Anglo-Saxon feasting culture. In premodern Britain, local men (men) would be invited to witness the lord‚Äôs power, in the form of bottomless food, and gorge themselves. By eating at the lord‚Äôs table they got a better meal than they were used to, and in doing so declared themselves grateful and therefor loyal to said lord. You can spin this factoid any way you want, but at the heart I think it‚Äôs interesting that care for the body in the form of food was these lords‚Äô chosen vehicle for forming a basis for their power. Not any other base need; FOOD. Not violent taking; generous GIVING.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>Still though, feeding someone is giving on another level. This isn‚Äôt buying carbon offsets or giving to a rent relief fund. As I see the look of pure worship that my baby wears when they see their favorite person (left boobie! right boobie is a close second) I can‚Äôt help but feel my body is just an extraction site, a landscape. It makes me a little queasy.  In high school social studies, a teacher taught us that extractive economic activities basically always exist at a power disadvantage to all economic activities that occur downstream of them ‚Äî even though they are only made possible by the extraction in the first place. I‚Äôm not a capitalist so I don‚Äôt really get why, but anyone can see it proven true if they compare the build cycle and profit distribution patterns for any product. Whether it‚Äôs an iPhone, a movie or a pair of jeans it‚Äôs always the same. Everyone knows the cotton farmer or miner of rare earths is getting ripped off. The creatives are given just enough to keep them selling their ideas, while the investors and executives who don‚Äôt make anything at all walk off with most of the profit. The landscape itself is thanklessly plundered. This isn‚Äôt a perfect  analogy though because if you look at rates of body-feeding, wealthier, more educated Americans are much more likely to do it, and to do it for longer than those with less privilege.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>Tired as I am, I really do feel lucky. Friends and family descend to help us adjust, cooking, cleaning, going up and down the stairs while I‚Äôm recovering. It feels poetic that, as I‚Äôm struggling to feed the newborn, others are feeding me. When I‚Äôm at a breaking point I try to remind myself of this fact. I try not to sulk openly too often, while everyone basks in the new-baby glow. I feel like it‚Äôs the least I can do. When our overflowing fridge at last empties out I watch my partner drink Soylent as an afternoon pick-me-up. It strikes me Soylent is a kind of VC-backed (vegan) adult breastmilk, mass-produced for infantile adults who‚Äôd rather stare at a screen than participate in food culture. I don‚Äôt say it out loud because my partner is actually a good cook and these days I‚Äôm vocally arguing with him about almost everything else. One night he tries some of The Good Stuff straight from the source. He says it‚Äôs really sugary.</p>

<h3 id="symbiosis">Symbiosis</h3>

<p>The baby gained physical health quickly, but our relationship took a bit longer. Feeding was this intimate space that me and the baby now could access, but neither of us exactly felt safe in there. I felt open to attack, and the baby felt like I was withholding the essential calorie they needed to live. I gave as much as I could, but not quite willingly. The baby was received, but not quite gratefully. At times it felt low-key traumatic, all forced limbs, tiny fingernails and red faced-baby tears. It was not the foundation I wanted for me and my child. But there was a glimmer of hope too. Rarely, usually in the dead of night, I‚Äôd respond to the baby‚Äôs hungry-cry and they‚Äôd open their eyes and magically be calm and patient. Slowly, I‚Äôd plop them on my chest. Squinty-eyed, they‚Äôd fumble, until they found the milk they were looking for, and drink til they were full. They didn‚Äôt howl or scratch, so I never had to grab their head and manually latch them (some people swear by this method, my baby hates it). I felt respected, so I let them take their time.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>If the baby and I were to continue as body-feeding partners, this is how I wanted it to be. We were partners in a way. We didn‚Äôt have language, and I held most of the power, but I could listen and respond with my actions. To preserve my self-respect, I set up ground rules with the baby. I would feed willingly when they asked me to, but if they started having a tantrum there would be a time-out, and me or someone else would gently calm them down. As cranky and sleep-deprived as I was, I started to realize the baby might be cranky and tired too, so we started helping them nap more. That was huge. It‚Äôs not always perfect, but mostly it works.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>What I took away from this, the most ordinary of miracles, is that symbiosis is a choice. The thing about our species is there is no ‚Äúdefault setting‚Äù. Reproduce, or not. Caretake, or not. Body-feed, or feed another way (fed is best). Dominate, or coexist. We choose the work we want to do in the world, and that in turn makes the world we give future generations to work in.</p>

<h3 id="smallness">Smallness</h3>

<p>Since the baby, my world has become suddenly very small, but also deep. Small moments have meaning. My baby won‚Äôt remember the relationship we had when it revolved around body-feeding them, and maybe I won‚Äôt either. But maybe we‚Äôll remember how it felt.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>I want them to remember the feeling that the world is abundant, but not infinite. To know what it feels like to be sated, so they don‚Äôt resort to gluttony or greed. To know what it feels like to be cared for so they‚Äôll know how to care for themself and others. I also want them to be scrappy and to tread on the Earth lightly. It feels somewhat reckless to be bringing a new human into the world when I know they‚Äôll have to grapple with a climate crisis, but it would feel awfully pessimistic not to, and so it‚Äôs important to me that the way in which we‚Äôre doing it be a vote for the kind of world I want my kid to be born into. As a techno-minimalist (tech is cool, products are fine, but if you don‚Äôt need to buy it let‚Äôs give the Earth a break) things like not owning a car, body-feeding, using cloth diapers are part of that. Not that any of it is enough.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>For all this I‚Äôm happy to do the work. The kind you do every day because it needs to be done, not because it‚Äôs celebrated, because you‚Äôre who‚Äôs there and you know it matters. I‚Äôm even proud to. And maybe Mary Cassatt is proud of us too. I hope she had enough people being proud of her in her time.</p>

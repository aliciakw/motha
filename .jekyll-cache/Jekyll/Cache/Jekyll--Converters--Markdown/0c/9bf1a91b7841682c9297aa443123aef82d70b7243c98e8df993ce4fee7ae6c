I"‘<p>I first encountered Curtis Talwst Santiagoâ€™s work when I popped into the Drawing Center in SoHo in and saw the first few rooms transformed into a multimedia installationÂ titled â€œCanâ€™t I Alterâ€. With this collection of mixed media drawings, video and sculpture, Santiago brings viewers along with him on a journey through a world fed with personal experience, imagination and research.</p>

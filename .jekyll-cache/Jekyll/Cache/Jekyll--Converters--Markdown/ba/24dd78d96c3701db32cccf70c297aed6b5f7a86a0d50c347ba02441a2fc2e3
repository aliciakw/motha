I"¯<p>For those of us who are the mutts of humanity - born into a people but not fully the ‚Äúreal version‚Äù, not sophisticated blends of endorsed European stock, but the descendents of survivors that weren‚Äôt necessarily winners (although maybe winning is surviving), a complete history is not often our birthright. Whether your ancestors were the colonized or the enslaved or crossing borders they were not meant to, your history is probably missing from books. It probably lives in stories - wisps of hearsay passed down from someone who happened to be in the room when an older relative happened to be telling stories, prejudices about the speaker twisting the weak points and layers of embellishment fossilizing to fill the space of things forgotten.</p>

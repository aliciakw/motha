I"Â<p>A FEW DAYS after the first cases of COVID-19 hit the streets of New York City, I was not yet cowering in my apartment. I found myself at Webster Hall in the East Village, defiantly packed into a crowd of fans waiting to see two members of the 070 collective. The opener 070 Phi rapped about his â€œlast year of being broke, family, and hustling. Then 070 Shake was just pure energy, a being from something like our collective imagination of the future come back to tell us some things about her life. The floor was sticky, a silver blow-up doll and an inflatable boat surfed the crowd, and a lot of 20 year olds from New Jersey obliviously elbowed me again and again. It was mostly worth the abuse.</p>

I"œ<p>It took me time to see Mary Cassatt. And then she saw me. The following is a bit of a love-letter:</p>

<p>Mary Cassatt is a familiar fixture if you‚Äôve heard of Impressionism. She painted a lot of women and children, used a. She was the lone female painter that was allowed to join the official group of Impressionists (although she did have loads of talented female contemporaries), but to me she didn‚Äôt really stand out. Her color palette was not as bold as Monet‚Äôs, her subjects not as exciting or varied as Manet‚Äôs, and her work didn‚Äôt undergo a dramatic public metamorphosis like Cezanne‚Äôs. Her subjects often sat in darkened rooms and looked demurely away. And the themes of motherhood and child-rearing felt romanticized and almost imaginary to me. I assumed she was celebrating the confines of old-school femininity. As a 21st century 20-something with an office job, this felt regressive at worst, and at best just not interesting.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>As I started painting more I began to appreciate her technical mastery. Cassatt has this unbelievable way of wrangling squirming humanity under her orderly influence without beating it into taxidermy-like submission. Even today, it‚Äôs better than a Live Photo or a Boomerang or any other painter at capturing a real person in a moment. The drawing is accurate, but the brush strokes are loose and painterly, responding to the texture and illumination of the surface she describes. It all feels effortlessly balanced on a knife‚Äôs edge as only Cassatt can channel. It made me jealous as I realized you could paint your entire life and probably never be able to do that. But I still was a bit irked that one of the few famous female painters focused so heavily on such boring subject matter.</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>And then life happened. I lost a lot of the internalized sexism that I‚Äôd held on to as a girl who grew up in a lot of male-dominated spaces (punk rock, art collectives, computer engineering). This summer I had my own baby, and suddenly a lot of my time got filled with the physical rituals of caring for it. The rhythm of these rituals seeped into my life and sense of self. And through doing that work myself, I started to see wonder if Cassatt‚Äôs paintings weren‚Äôt really celebrating the Romanticism of Motherhood as much as the nobility of invisible female labor.</p>

<p>Was Cassatt really a feminist though? She totally was. Experience trying to survive in male-dominated spaces would tell you she‚Äôd be just as likely to advocate for the advancement of other women as to be one of those annoying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve-got-mine-now-you-get-yours‚Äù types who see other talented women as a threat, but she was definitely the former. Check out Cassatt‚Äôs (suspiciously destroyed/lost) mural for the Women‚Äôs Pavilion at the 1893 Chicago World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition and you won‚Äôt doubt it. She even had tons of talented female contemporaries (I caught an exhibition called Women In Motion at PAFA that was dedicated to several of them). Cassatt never married or had children, perhaps believing (not irrationally) taking on that vocation might preclude her ability to work as a painter, but she spent a lot of time with women who did take a more traditional path. While her male counterparts were able to work from the nude figure (women were not), Cassatt spent time contemplating the female figure in the context of domestic work. In private spaces, day after day, Cassatt saw women bathe, hold, cajole, and feed tiny humans, and for whatever reason decided their work was worthy of depiction. And the depictions are not stuffy vanity portraits of rich families and their angelic children ‚Äî they‚Äôre real, they do show the work.</p>

<p>And so, as a new mom, sweaty and exhausted and struggling to feed my newborn at 3am, feeling grumpy yet proud to for once be doing essential labor, if Cassatt saw me, saw us, being as hard-working and dependable as Diego Rivera saw the motor workers in a Detroit factory. It felt nice.</p>

<h3 id="body-feeding">Body-Feeding</h3>

<p>What‚Äôs it been like learning to be a bodyfeeder?</p>

<div class="Post__spacer"></div>

<p>Physical, emotional, and round-the clock. And completely different from the work done in my professional life. In my professional life I work at an agency where I‚Äôm a web developer. There are agreed-upon hours, contracts, coworkers, variety. It‚Äôs creative and intellectual work. (Before doing the family thing I primarily saw my ‚Äúself‚Äù as a brain that was being carried around by my body, though this year has done a lot to upend that). I‚Äôm good at it, and if I wasn‚Äôt, I could be easily replaced. The work/life balance is good, and if it wasn‚Äôt they could hire another person or I could change jobs. By contrast body feeding has none of this translatable flexibility. Biology seems to ideally prefer a ‚Äúone-baby, one feeder‚Äù relationship ‚Äî lactation is an ability only unlocked by birth, and furthermore the amount of milk produced is carefully calibrated between  the baby and feeder via supply and demand. Finally, feeding is <em>essential.</em> This might sound romantic and self-important but it also means that someone else has a claim on your body and its labor. <em>Essential</em> things must be done when they need to be done, leaving the worker vulnerable to overwork and burnout. The worker being me.</p>

I"”<p>For those of us who are the mutts of humanity - born into a people but not fully the ‚Äúreal version‚Äù, not sophisticated blends of endorsed European stock, but the descendents of survivors that weren‚Äôt necessarily winners (although maybe winning is surviving), a complete history is not often our birthright. Whether your ancestors were the colonized or the enslaved or crossing borders they were not meant to, your history is probably missing from books.</p>

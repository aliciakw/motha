I"Ò<p>For those of us who are the mutts of humanity - born into a people but not fully the ‚Äúreal version‚Äù, not sophisticated blends of endorsed European stock, but the descendents of survivors that weren‚Äôt necessarily winners (although maybe winning is surviving), a complete history is not often our birthright. Whether your ancestors were the colonized or the enslaved or crossing borders they were not meant to, your history is probably missing from books.</p>

<p>It probably lives in stories - wisps of hearsay passed down from someone who happened to be in the room when an older relative was telling stories, prejudices about the speaker twisting the weak points and layers of embellishment fossilizing to fill the space of things forgotten. And where are the facts? In some dusty old tome; perhaps missing.</p>

<p>Trying to piece together the history of artist Curtis Talwst Santiago likewise requires a little bit of effort. He has a Wikipedia page describing him as a Toronto-based dance-rock musician from Edmonton, Alberta, but to find his exact birth year (1979) one needs to click through several gallery page exhibition blurbs to find an extra-verbose CV. Other features highlight different aspects of his prolific career, such as his dioramas or video work, but in an attempt to maintain focus, ignore one another.</p>

<p>I first encountered Curtis Talwst Santiago‚Äôs work when I popped into the Drawing Center in SoHo in early 2020 and saw the first few rooms of the gallery transformed into the multimedia installation <em>Can‚Äôt I Alter</em>. With this collection of mixed media drawings and sculpture, Santiago brings viewers along with him on a journey through a world fed with childhood memories, imagination and research.</p>

<p>From a stark childhood memory of his first encounter with J‚ÄôOuvert, a Trinidadi festival commemorating the first time formerly enslaved people could celebrate Carnival and a recent quest into the origins of a 16th century Flemish painting depicting an African Knight of the Order or Santiago, the artist birthed Sir Dingolay. Serving as both the show‚Äôs hero and the artist‚Äôs alter ego, Dingolay is on of the threads that ties together Can‚Äôt I Alter‚Äôs disparate elemements.</p>

<p>Another motif is ‚Äúred face‚Äù.</p>

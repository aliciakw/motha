I"ËJ<p><em>Lately I‚Äôve realized a major crisis affecting my ability to make art and take up space in the world is the feeling that as a mixed person, I culturally don‚Äôt exist. This felt like a major roadblock, until the movie ‚ÄúThe Watermelon Woman‚Äù introduced me to the idea that you can write your own history. Then I rembered my friend Sen had participated in a workshop where they explored just this topic. I called them up back in August and asked them a bunch of questions about it!</em>
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> In 2019 you were part of a printmaking workshop called The Queer Ancestors Project, where you discovered your own Queer ancestors and made artwork that told the story of them and of you. How did you become involved in this project?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> I think I found the Queer Ancestors Project from an ad on Instagram, and it was billed as a free linocut workshop for Queer people aged 18-26 with any range of experience in linocut printing. I think part of the reason it was attractive to me was that I‚Äôve always had some level of impostor syndrome around the idea of doing art, because I think the way I was raised was very anti-pursuing-art-as-a-career and also anti-hobby. It allowed me to put everything into what I was working on and really invest in it because there was a goal [(the closing reception)] and then afterwards start divesting from having goals in my art practice.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> So it was as much about the art as it was the ancestry and Queer culture.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Yeah, very much.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> What was being in the program like?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> We had some structure and some freedom. We had to make four prints. For the first print we had to just pick a queer ancestor, and Katie gave us a list that we could choose from but we didn‚Äôt have to, and we also had a visit to the GLBT archives which are super fucking cool!
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> How did you decide what to make prints about?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> I started out wanting to look into Queer Asian history, because I don‚Äôt really know much about Asian American history, let alone Queer Asian American history, and I think I had a lot of assumptions based on my experiences growing up: that Asian American activism was all like, shitty assimilationist politics, since the suburb that I grew up in was very much like ‚ÄúChinese Americans Against Affirmative Action‚Äù type activism. Being in the Bay Area I‚Äôm starting to realize that there‚Äôs a really really deep history of radical Asian American Activism and radical Queer Asian American Activism that I was really close to.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> The Queer Ancestors Project has an <a href="&quot;https://www.queerancestorsproject.org/2019-2020-artists&quot;">online gallery</a> featuring work from participants over the years. It‚Äôs so clear that each artist has a story to tell and a unique way of using linocut to do that. Could I ask you talk about the prints you made?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Yeah absolutely!

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> Cool! So the first is titled ‚ÄúPhoenix Rising.‚Äù Could you talk about what went into making this print?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> The phoenix one was the first print I ever did, and it was also the first time I‚Äôd done art in like, forever. I really wanted to do Asian imagery, and I think it was my first time incorporating Asian imagery into any artwork I was doing. One thing I wanted to do in that piece was [play with] the fenghuang (phoenix) and the dragon pairing. They are a really traditional heterosexual Chinese pairing, like yin and yang, or the emperor and the empress, man and wife. There‚Äôs some implication that the phoenix is pure and delicate and the dragon is strong and can attack, and in having two phoenixes as a pair instead I really wanted them to be interdependent, like, I didn‚Äôt want there to be a power dynamic. The way I portrayed them I wanted them to be both attacking an unseen opponent and both defending each other. I think that represents the kind of ‚ÄúFor Us, By Us‚Äù [attitude] I‚Äôd like to see in our community.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> One of the members of Phoenix Rising was eventually invited to speak as part of the workshop. What did it mean to you to personally encounter these activists and artists who came before you?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> I got to meet two elders in person, one was Giselle Cohan, and she was one of the co-founders of Phoenix Rising, which was the first Asian American Lesbian newsletter in the United States, and it was basically a publication they‚Äôd send out monthly for several years. It had picnics, or like news about a gathering in the forest a bunch of Asian Queers did one weekend, and fundraisers and personals. It was super interesting because she works in tech [like me, and] the way she talks about herself she makes it seem like she has a pretty quiet life, despite [her involvement being] so seminal and so historical. [It] allowed me to unpack some of the guilt that I had about being here and being in tech and just the things that I was navigating. And then I also got meet Kitty Tsui, although we didn‚Äôt actually get to talk.

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> Speaking of Kitty Tsui, you ended up honoring her with a print as well. It‚Äôs a really powerful image, with bold square lines framing the powerful contours and textures of Tsui‚Äôs athletic body ‚Äî a body that is literally busting out of the frame. 
<br /><br /></p>

<p>In your artist‚Äôs statement you reference Tsui in 1996, ‚ÄúGrowing up in Hong Kong, I heard all around me mothers yelling at their children: ‚ÄòSay nui, mo no, mo yung!‚Äô Dead girl, no brain, no use‚Ä¶ For me as an Asian/Pacific lesbian, silence is not an option. To ensure that we‚Ä¶be acknowledged as who we are. Women with a history‚Ä¶Women who survived being dead girls.‚Äù¬†(‚ÄúAsian Pacific Lesbian a.k.a Dead Girl, China Doll, Dragon Lady, or the Invisible Man‚Äù). 
<br /><br /></p>

<p>What do you think it means to be a ‚Äúdead girl‚Äù? I‚Äôve never heard that phrase before.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> I‚Äôd never actually heard it before either. I think the way Kitty was talking about it was probably talking about pretty misogynistic culture, and I think in that sense Chinese culture is very misogynistic.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>The other day my mom sent me this photo of an old Chinese scroll that had like two poems and I asked her to translate them for me and she said the first poem is about raising a daughter and how your daughter is the most delicate flower that you spend all your days watering and it grows so beautiful and slender and delicate and you do everything you can to make it grow as beautifully as possible, and one day a man comes and plucks it with no thanks to you! And then the second half is about raising a son, like raising a son is like opening a bank account that you deposit all your money into, and you work so hard and you deposit everything into it, and then one day this woman comes and just takes the whole bank account without any gratitude. And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòThis is like so awful, why would you send me this??‚Äô So I think there‚Äôs all this history of the one child policy and how there aren‚Äôt enough girls because everyone only wanted men, because they keep the family line going, etc. etc., and women aren‚Äôt necessarily supposed to be out there having their own opinions. It‚Äôs very confusing, I don‚Äôt really get it. But I think maybe that‚Äôs partially what it‚Äôs about‚Ä¶
<br /><br /></p>

<p>OH actually, I just found it: In this Cantonese dictionary, there‚Äôs this term ‚Äúbad girl,‚Äù like in the way you might say to you cat ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being a bad girl!‚Äù It‚Äôs an abusive term for a bad girl, and the characters in it are literally like ‚Äúdead‚Äù ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù or ‚Äúdead‚Äù ‚Äúwoman‚Äù.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> I mean I guess people say some mean things to their kids when they want them to behave. It‚Äôs funny how people say so many throw-away things to children when they‚Äôre young and we really internalize them and remember them even after we‚Äôre much older. The way Tsui holds up this memory as she‚Äôs encouraging other Queer Asians not to be silenced is a really cool piece of writing. First in the way she humanizes herself as not this invincible activist but a person who still grapples with her past to be able to speak her truth. It also reminds me of the slogan from the AIDS crisis ‚ÄúSilence = Death,‚Äù implying that together her community can turn it on its head. Like if silence will kill you, speaking your truth might make you more alive.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> I like that a lot. That reminds be a little bit of this Junot Diaz‚Äôs quote: 
<br /><br />
‚Äú‚Ä¶if you want to make a human being into a monster, deny them, at the cultural level, any reflection of themselves. And growing up, I felt like a monster in some ways. I didn‚Äôt see myself reflected at all. I was like, ‚ÄúYo, is something wrong with me? That the whole society seems to think that people like me don‚Äôt exist?‚Äù And part of what inspired me, was this deep desire that before I died, I would make a couple of mirrors. That I would make some mirrors so that kids like me might see themselves reflected back and might not feel so monstrous for it.‚Äù

<p><strong>AN:</strong> I think my favorite work from this series is your self portrait. Printed in smoldering tones of red, orange and yellow, you depict yourself sitting nude, eyes closed and maintaining immense focus despite the dragon curled around you hanging over your right shoulder. It just gives off this intense aura of inner strength. Could you take me through what‚Äôs going on here?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> It‚Äôs styled after these paintings [called thanka paintings] that are hung throughout my aunt and grandmother‚Äôs homes that are from the Tibetan buddhist tradition, usually portraying the Buddha near a place that you would pray. Part of that tradition as well is to be able to look at this portrayal of the Buddha or some deity-type figure, and be able to when meditating be able to think about all the Buddha-like qualities and aspire to embody them in yourself. I added an eastern-style dragon that was wrapped around the halo, which also looks like a bubble or a protective circle. I think one of the things I was trying to do with the dragon is to make it unclear whether or not the dragon was protecting me or trying to harm me. That sort of perceived tension was meant to symbolize my relationship with my feelings. I was in a place in my life where I was realizing, despite thinking that I took time to feel my feelings every day, in retrospect I was actually pretty dissociated from them. My partner had mentioned that it would take me a long time to process my feelings, or I wouldn‚Äôt be even aware that I was feeling certain ways, like angry or defensive, [or] reacting in a triggered way. I had this sort of fantasy of myself as a person who was completely aware of my feelings and in control. And so it was also about that journey and trying to unpack my relationship with them.</p>

<p>And then part of it was I think me trying to get more comfortable with my body, which is why I did a nude self portrait. I definitely have and continue to have a lot of internalized fat-phobia and I think it‚Äôs something I really want to work on, and I am also realizing that I can‚Äôt work on it through anything other than working on my relationship with my own body and how I perceive it. That‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs naked.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> All of that is incredibly rad. I also think it‚Äôs pretty radical that you place yourself right smack in the center of this devotional image, this object you‚Äôre supposed look at and think about when you are meditating. Are you saying you are your own ancestor in a way, that you‚Äôre your own God?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Something we talked about a lot during the workshop was ‚ÄúWho are your Queer Ancestors?‚Äù  I think the notion of family has always been a really difficult one for me because I don‚Äôt feel like I have ‚ÄúFamily‚Äô in the way that maybe the Western tradition conditions you to think about what family should mean. And I think in terms of Queer role models, my elders and role models are mainly just my friends. This applies in other areas too, like with work and stuff, there‚Äôs no one person or people that I am able to pattern-match when it comes to what I want out of my life. I think a lot of the people my parents would like me to think of as role models are really antithetical to the things that I want.
I think there‚Äôs an aspect of loneliness to it too that I‚Äôm really only reflecting on now. I don‚Äôt really have my own gods. My own spirituality is very made-up and very personalized to me. I draw from a lot of different influences. My role models are all very piecemeal, and different things in different people. I don‚Äôt really have professional mentors, or people that I admire who are in a mentorship position. So I might be drawing on some of that. I don‚Äôt think I even thought about it that much, so it‚Äôs interesting to talk about it now.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> Well I think its really awesome and brave the way you have been forging your own path in that way. Thanks for sharing that, and being vulnerable. 
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Thanks for asking and giving me space to talk about it.

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> How did it feel to share all of this with the world at the closing reception?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> It felt really good. It was such a trip. It was really packed, and it was really interesting to have people come up to me and say ‚ÄùWow, your art made me think about these things,‚Äù which was really sweet. Katie [Gilmartin, printmaker and creator of the Queer Ancestors Program] said one of her favorite parts about being the featured artist is you can talk to anyone you want at the entire event, and you‚Äôll always have an excuse to do so, and I loved that, it‚Äôs so true. And as somebody who likes being able to meet people and not having to deal with social pressures or cues it was great to be able to show up at this thing, dress however the fuck I want. It was my first time really being in ‚Äúthe art world‚Äù and knowing without the shadow of a doubt that I could take up as much space as I wanted, and that made a lot of sense in the room.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> That‚Äôs so inspirational. I think there are definitely lessons in there that I‚Äôm trying to learn‚Ä¶ And it sounds like you ended up finding what you were looking for when you first engaged with the Queer Ancestors Project?
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>SL:</strong> Yeah, I think so! Maybe instead of feeling less like an impostor I feel I care less about the idea that there are rules or that there‚Äôs an institution I‚Äôm trying to break into.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>AN:</strong> I think you definitely have a lot to say. Thanks so much for talking with me and sharing this experience. I‚Äôm looking forward to see what you make next!

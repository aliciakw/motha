I"Å<p>It took me time to see Mary Cassatt. And then she saw me. The following is a bit of a love-letter:</p>

<p>Mary Cassatt is a familiar fixture if you‚Äôve heard of Impressionism. She painted a lot of women and children, used a. She was the lone female painter that was allowed to join the official group of Impressionists (although she did have loads of talented female contemporaries), but to me she didn‚Äôt really stand out. Her color palette was not as bold as Monet‚Äôs, her subjects not as exciting or varied as Manet‚Äôs, and her work didn‚Äôt undergo a dramatic public metamorphosis like Cezanne‚Äôs. Her subjects often sat in darkened rooms and looked demurely away. And the themes of motherhood and child-rearing felt romanticized and almost imaginary to me. I assumed she was celebrating the confines of old-school femininity. As a 21st century 20-something with an office job, this felt regressive at worst, and at best just not interesting.</p>

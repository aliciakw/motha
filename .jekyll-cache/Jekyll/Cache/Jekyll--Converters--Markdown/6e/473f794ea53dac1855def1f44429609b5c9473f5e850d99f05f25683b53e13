I"õ<p><em>Lately Iâ€™ve realized a major crisis affecting my ability to make art and take up space in the world is in feeling like, as a mixed person, I culturally donâ€™t exist. This felt like a major roadblock, until the movie â€œThe Watermelon Womanâ€ introduced me to the idea that you can write your own history. Then I rembered my friend Sen had participated in a workshop where they explored just this topic. I called them up back in August and asked them a bunch of questions about it.</em></p>

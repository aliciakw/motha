I"Ã	<p>It took me time to see Mary Cassatt. And then she saw me. The following is a bit of a love-letter:</p>

<p>Mary Cassatt is a familiar fixture if youâ€™ve heard of Impressionism. She painted a lot of women and children, used a. She was the lone female painter that was allowed to join the official group of Impressionists (although she did have loads of talented female contemporaries), but to me she didnâ€™t really stand out. Her color palette was not as bold as Monetâ€™s, her subjects not as exciting or varied as Manetâ€™s, and her work didnâ€™t undergo a dramatic public metamorphosis like Cezanneâ€™s. Her subjects often sat in darkened rooms and looked demurely away. And the themes of motherhood and child-rearing felt romanticized and almost imaginary to me. I assumed she was celebrating the confines of old-school femininity. As a 21st century 20-something with an office job, this felt regressive at worst, and at best just not interesting.</p>

<p>As I started painting more I began to appreciate her technical mastery. Cassatt has this unbelievable way of wrangling squirming humanity under her orderly influence without beating it into taxidermy-like submission. Even today, itâ€™s better than a Live Photo or a Boomerang or any other painter at capturing a real person in a moment. The drawing is accurate, but the brush strokes are loose and painterly, responding to the texture and illumination of the surface she describes. It all feels effortlessly balanced on a knifeâ€™s edge as only Cassatt can channel. It made me jealous as I realized you could paint your entire life and probably never be able to do that. But I still was a bit irked that one of the few famous female painters focused so heavily on such boring subject matter.</p>
